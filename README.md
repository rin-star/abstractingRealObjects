## Getting Started

Welcome to the Bird Simulation Project. This program models a real-world object, a Bird, using Java classes. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles such as encapsulation, composition, constructors, method overloading, and behaviors.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains the following folders:

* `src`: contains the Java source files (`Bird.java`, `Wing.java`, `BirdTester.java`)
* `lib`: contains any dependencies if added
* `bin`: the folder where compiled `.class` files are generated by default

If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Classes Overview

### Bird.java

Represents the main class for the bird object.
Includes:

* Six instance variables (`color`, `size`, `weight`, `energyLevel`, `health`, and `wing`)
* Two constructors (default and parameterized)
* Accessor and mutator methods for all variables
* Four behavior methods (`fly()`, `eat(double)`, `heal()`, `displayStatus()`)
* A `toString()` method for displaying information about the bird

### Wing.java

Represents the secondary class used within the Bird class.
Includes:

* One instance variable (`wingStrength`)
* Accessor and mutator methods
* A `toString()` method for descriptive output

### BirdTester.java

Contains the `main()` method used to test the Bird and Wing classes.
Demonstrates:

* Object creation using both constructors
* Calling behavior methods with and without parameters
* Printing the object’s state using `toString()`

## How to Run

1. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. Compile the Java files:

   ```bash
   javac -d bin src/*.java
   ```
3. Run the tester class:

   ```bash
   java -cp bin BirdTester
   ```

## Example Output

```
Bird [color = Unknown, size = 0.0, weight = 0.0, energyLevel = 100.0, health = 100.0, wingStrength = 50.0]
Bird [color = Blue, size = 1.5, weight = 2.3, energyLevel = 80.0, health = 90.0, wingStrength = 70.0]
The bird has eaten and gained energy.
The bird has eaten and gained energy.
The bird is flying!
The bird is flying!
Bird Status: Bird [color = Unknown, size = 0.0, weight = 0.0, energyLevel = 110.0, health = 95.0, wingStrength = 50.0]
Bird Status: Bird [color = Blue, size = 1.5, weight = 2.3, energyLevel = 85.0, health = 85.0, wingStrength = 70.0]
```

## Learning Objectives

* Write and call constructors, including overloaded constructors.
* Write methods with parameters and return values.
* Write and use custom classes in Java.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view in Visual Studio Code allows you to manage dependencies. More details can be found in the [VS Code Java Dependency Guide](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
